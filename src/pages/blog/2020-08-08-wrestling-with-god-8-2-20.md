description: "“Like every founding myth, in other words, Hamilton tells us at
  least as much about how we imagine ourselves today as it does about what
  happened years ago. And so I find it completely delightful that this bizarre
  tale from Genesis is how the Bible tells the story of the founding of the
  people of God. Because the moment when Jacob wrestles with God is like the
  Bible’s equivalent of the Declaration of Independence: it’s one of a handful
  of turning points in the relationship between God and humankind.“"
